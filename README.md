Hey there! This is a repository that contains all of the notes from ACM @ UTA's for our frontend workshop series. This series is designed to give developers with **zero prior web development experience** enough of a primer to make high-quality beautiful and interactive front-end applications.

While these notes are a good starting point, simply reading through all of these notes is not nearly enough to become a pro web developer! We aimed to give enough of a foundational background and a primer into each relevant area; however, to make great web applications, developers need to **practice aggressively**.

Workshops will be updated here weekly until the conclusion of the series.
