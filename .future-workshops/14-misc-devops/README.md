# Misc DevOps

[Link to Video.](https://youtu.be/HH2c3YZZasg)

Unlike other of our videos, this one is more of an optional *walkthrough* element. We decided to do this since this step is somewhat optional, as Matt set up these tools for our existing learning labs. We either recommend watching the above video (on 2x speed, that's ok!), or simply to read each of the following links:

* Netlify: https://www.netlify.com/
* GitHub Actions: https://github.com/features/actions
* GitHub Pages: https://pages.github.com/
* Understanding the Git Flow: https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/

If you have any questions, please reach out to Matt & Leo!
