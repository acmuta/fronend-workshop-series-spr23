# Task 1: Make a Portfolio Website!

The best way to learn web development, plain and simple, is to practice. So, let's get to it!

We'll hit two birds with one stone by making a personal portfolio website! These websites are very popular with software engineers, data scientists, product designers, UI/UX designers, and lots of other people involved in tech. It's basically a walking r√©sum√©, except *you* get to control **every aspect of it!**

In this doc, we'll outline some suggestions on how you can use what you've learned to make your own personal website. However, you definitely don't *need* to follow any of these steps! After that, we'll also teach you how to deploy your personal website with GitHub Pages, so anybody can see it!

## Overview & Key Goals

At the end of the day, your personal website is **yours**. We're not going to tell you what has to be on it, what doesn't, or what looks bad or good. **You decide!**

Like the rest of this crash course, the onus is on you to practice what you've learned, and put your best foot out there! That being said, here are some common things that you'll probably end up practicing by making your website:

* general basic understanding of HTML & CSS
* choosing an overall design scheme (with colors, fonts, etc.)
* adding color to your website with `color`, `background-color`, `border`, and other properties
* using `margin`, `padding`, `position`, CSS Grid, or Flexbox to make the spacing on your site *just right!*
* using the `<a>` tag to link to your GitHub, LinkedIn, email, etc.
* using the `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<li>` tags to create lists of content (like all your awesome skills!)
* creating complex layouts with flexbox or CSS grid
* creating your own visual components using a combination of HTML and CSS (like a card, tag, or navbar)
* use the right HTML tags to convey your page structure, even to those who use screen readers

Note that using JS is optional: some people use it, and some don't. Do what feels right for you!

We also want you to get used to using `git` and GitHub. We'll talk a bit about these tools in text below, but we'll be a bit brief (there are many, many `git` and GitHub tutorials out there).

## Inspirations

Very quickly, let's run through some examples of cool designs for personal websites (though to be honest, this is also just a chance for Matt to show you some cool people he knows).

Many people choose minimal websites that are content-focused and driven. Here are a few examples:

* [https://krashanoff.com/](https://krashanoff.com/) - Leo's website! It gives you just enough information about him, and a unique feel of what he's like.
* [https://marceloneil.com/](https://marceloneil.com/) - Marcel is one of Matt's high school friends who does amazing stuff with computers, and his website is dead-simple but cool. It's actually a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme, but you can probably implement it yourself!
* [https://kandrewz.github.io/](https://kandrewz.github.io/) - Andrew is a CS student at UCLA, and also makes very cool interactive stories for Daily Bruin. His website is simple, easy to navigate, and elegant.
* [https://neerajsamtani.me/](https://neerajsamtani.me/) - Neeraj is one of the first people that Matt ever met at UCLA, and is just as awesome today as he was on day 1. His website is simple, but still conveys a lot about his personality, his design choices, and what he does!
* [https://jasonjewik.github.io/](https://jasonjewik.github.io/) - ACM AI's very own superstar Jason Jewik! His website puts all of the important content front-and-center, and you know he's hip with the kids because he uses emojis üëÄ.

These next three are all more blog-focused, but still have good lessons to learn from:

* [https://markdotto.com/](https://markdotto.com/) - Mark Otto is one of the founders of Bootstrap, probably the most popular CSS framework to exist. His website is simple, but great.
* [https://thume.ca/](https://thume.ca/) - Tristan Hume is a Canadian software engineer who works at Jane Street, and writes some of the most interesting blog posts that Matt reads. His website is simple, with nothing flasy, but easy to navigate.
* [https://andrewkelley.me/](https://andrewkelley.me/) - Andrew Kelley is the main developer behind Zig, a new programming language with a large online following and lots of cool features. Note that his website is similarly minimal with Tristan's.

We think sites like the ones we showed above are a great place to start, and probably what you should focus on for this project. The best sites don't necessarily have to be overly complex: minimal but clean is much better than flashy and messy. In particular, you'll notice the phrase "simple and easy to navigate" appears a few times: on a portfolio page, that's probably the most important thing (other than you üòâ).

But for fun, let's see a bit more.

Sometimes, you can add small features to make your website just a bit more distinct than others. Here are a few examples:

* [https://carolchen.me/](https://carolchen.me/) - Carol is one of the smartest software engineers that Matt has ever met, and her website shows it! Two features that he loves are the randomization of certain elements on load, and the slider that lets users pick how much information they want.
* [https://www.emmycao.com/](https://www.emmycao.com/) - Emmy is one of leads at Creative Labs at UCLA, and also one of the coolest designers we know (and she can tell you a lot about Maryland). We think she does an especially great job at using color, spacing, and fonts to create a very visually cohesive website.
* [https://sindresorhus.com/](https://sindresorhus.com/) - Sindre Sorhus is one of GitHub's most famous celebrities, creating hundreds of popular open-source packages (mostly for Node.js and Swift). His website gives you a taste of everything he's done, including live (JS) metrics on what he does - you can stalk him realtime!
* [https://nickelder.ca/](https://nickelder.ca/) - Nick was one of Matt's web development mentors in high school. His website just gives you an amazingly clean feeling, one that screams meticulousness and professionalism.

And sometimes, you can go flashy. Here are some websites that do a lot, and say a lot. We will say, all of these websites have benefits and tradeoffs: as we mentioned earlier, flashy doesn't always mean great (and in particular, accessible):

* [https://lam.io/](https://lam.io/) - Derek was also one of Matt's web development mentors in high school. The amount of unique design customization on this website, down to writing his own sharding library, is insane. This is the kind of website that you don't ever really forget.
* [https://jgthms.com/](https://jgthms.com/) - Jeremy Thomas is the creator of [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), one of the web's most popular CSS frameworks. So it's no doubt that he has an enticing website, with a sense of vibrancy and dynamism that makes you want to hire him. Oh, and a light mode/dark mode toggle!
* [https://www.strml.net/](https://www.strml.net/) - Samuel Reed's website went viral on Twitter, Reddit, and HackerNews, and for good reason. He literally constructs his website, right in front of you. By far one of the most innovative websites we've seen.
* [http://www.rleonardi.com/interactive-resume/](http://www.rleonardi.com/interactive-resume/) - Okay, Robby Leonardi literally made his website an interactive game. He wins.
* [http://mihirmathur.com/](http://mihirmathur.com/) - Mihir was a previous president of ACM @ UCLA! While his website has the general flow and layout of most websites, there are so many design microinteractions that just make his site pleasant to use.

## A Brief Intro with git

*You might find [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com), a visual interface for git, very helpful. We'll still go over the command-line steps, but there's no shame in using a UI!*

Here, we're assuming you're using a Unix-based shell (e.g. macOS, Linux, or Git Bash on Windows).

### Setup

Okay, how do we get started? We'll start by creating a folder, and then a git repository:

```sh
$ mkdir personal-portfolio
$ cd personal-portfolio
$ git init
...
```

`git init` creates an empty "git repository" in your folder.

Now, you make some changes.

```sh
$ echo "This is my personal portfolio" >> README.md
...
```

Now, we can check what `git` sees with `git status`:

```sh
$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
    README.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

This is an important distinction. Just because we've changed a file, doesn't mean it'll be updated just yet. To do that, we need to move it to staging, using `git add`; we're going to cheat and use the glob pattern `*`, which means all files (but we could've also done `git add README.md`):

```sh
$ git add *
$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
    new file:   README.md
```

Great! Now we have files ready to be committed. Let's commit, with `git commit`

```sh
$ git commit -m "adding my README file"
...
```

The `-m` argument says to use the message from the command line, rather than entering a text editor.

Now, all that's left is to push our changes to GitHub. But wait! We haven't even told GitHub we're going to do something! So let's do that first!

Head to GitHub, and create a new repository. Two important things:

* make your repository name `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io` - you'll see why in a moment!
* don't "Initialize this repository with a README", add a `.gitignore`, or a license - we're going to import an existing repository!

Next, you'll get a prompt to "push an existing repository from the command line"; follow those commands:

```sh
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io
...
```

Great, and now we're ready. We can finally run `git push`!

```sh
$ git push -u origin master
...
```

Now, if you head to your GitHub repository, you should see your changes pushed!

### The Typical Workflow

Now that we've got our repository all setup, here's what we do every time we want to make a new change:

* make your changes
* add all relevant files with `git add`
* use `git commit` to commit your changes locally
* run `git push` to send them to our origin (in this case, GitHub)
* double-check everything looks good on GitHub!

Note: we haven't talked about branches and pull requests yet. We'll do that for our next task, don't you worry!

## Deploying Your Website with GitHub Pages

**TL;DR: [read this guide](https://pages.github.com/).**

You want to show off your website to the world! The fancy word for being able to put your website on the internet is called *deploying* your website (or web application).

Your portfolio will probably be a *static website*, which means that there's no back-end, database, or dynamic process required to run your website - it's "static"! If your website is static, there are many different free options to deploy your website - which is an incentive to put as much into the frontend as possible!

One such option is [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), a static-site deployment provider made by GitHub! The biggest advantage: of GitHub Pages are

* It integrates *really easily* with GitHub, with no configuration required!
* You get a relatively clean URL (e.g. `krashanoff.github.io`) compared to other things like Netlify

In fact, if you followed the instructions above, it's already been configured for you! If you make a repository of the form `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io`, GitHub is pretty smart and automatically deploys the content of your repository to the domain `https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io` (i.e. if you made a file `me.html`, then it would be at `https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/me.html`) - with no extra steps! How *extremely* convenient!!!

GitHub Pages does a bit more than that too - you can create a Pages site for each repository that you have, and use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to super-charge your site! You can [review the documentation](https://pages.github.com/) for more information!

As an addendum, we'll talk about [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), another popular static site host! It has a lot of flexibility that GitHub Pages doesn't offer, but is a bit more complicated to set up.
